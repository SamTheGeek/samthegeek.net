# Agent Guidance

This repository uses two guidance files for assistants:

- `STATUS.md` for current status, active tasks, and suggested work.
- `AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for coding instructions, workflows, and project conventions.

If anything conflicts, follow `AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` and update `STATUS.md` with progress.
