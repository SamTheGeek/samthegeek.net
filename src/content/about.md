# Hi! I'm Sam.

I ride bicycles, play with various technology, and lead product management at [HYPR](https://www.hypr.com).

I've worked for companies of all sizes - from the biggest in the world, all the way down to my own small business. I've cofounded and taken companies through IPO. I help push great teams and great people to do even greater things.

The things that I've worked on - those that are public, anyway - are the [SAMATE project](http://samate.nist.gov/Main_Page.html) at NIST, the [OSCAAR project](https://code.google.com/p/oscaar/) at The University of Maryland, and the [Apple Store App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-store/id375380948). I've done project management for hardware (which we didn't ship), software (which we did), and small-sized corporate level IT deployments. I previously founded and led the Technical Product Management team at [Oscar Insurance](https://hioscar.com), helped found [Baton Health](https://www.batonhealth.com), and advised a lot of my friends' startups.

If you want to find me on the internet, look for [SamTheGeek](https://bsky.app/profile/samthegeek.net) - it's probably [me](https://mastodon.social/@SamTheGeek?rel=me).
