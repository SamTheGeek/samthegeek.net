There's a fascinating parallel between the evolution of computing and the transformation of the automotive industry. Both followed similar arcs, and understanding one helps predict the future of the other.

## The Computing Revolution

Apple's A-series chips, originally designed for phones, now power their mainstream computers. The M1, M2, and beyond are direct descendants of mobile processors—optimized for efficiency, designed for battery life, but scaled up to deliver desktop-class performance.

This wasn't inevitable. For years, conventional wisdom said mobile chips could never match desktop processors. But Apple proved that with the right architecture and enough iteration, a chip designed for a phone could outperform Intel's best.

## The Automotive Parallel

The same thing happened in cars. Compact vehicles with all-terrain capability—what we now call crossovers—were dismissed as underpowered compromises. But they got better. And better. And eventually, they became the default choice for most buyers.

Today, the traditional sedan and the body-on-frame SUV are both endangered species. The crossover won.

## What Comes Next?

In computing, we're already seeing the pattern. The mobile-first processor architecture is eating everything. Desktop chips are becoming specialized tools for specific workloads, not the mainstream default.

In transportation, I believe we'll see the same shift. The future isn't bigger, more powerful vehicles. It's specialized, efficient devices optimized for their specific use case. Just like computing moved from general-purpose desktops to a diverse ecosystem of specialized devices, transportation will fragment into purpose-built solutions.

The crossover won. But the crossover is just the beginning.
