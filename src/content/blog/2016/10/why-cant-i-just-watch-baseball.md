Last night I was frustrated. Not by the Cubs, who are making a historic playoff run — and who I'm hoping will win their first title since the fall of the Ottoman Empire — but by my inability to watch it. I tried three different, entirely legal, ways to watch the Cubs-Dodgers game and was stymied each time. You'd reasonably assume that postseason baseball is widely viewed enough that it'd be available over-the-air in the largest media market, but no dice. Due to a [complicated and ridiculous TV deal](http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/8453054/major-league-baseball-completes-eight-year-deal-fox-turner-sports), Fox owns these games, but chooses to air them on their new sports channel, Fox Sports 1 — thus forcing cable providers to include it in basic cable packages. As a card-carrying millennial, I don't have cable, preferring the extra $64.95 per month to spend on 🎮 and 🍺. It turns out that the *other* two ways I have of watching baseball also were blocked. Thanks to [Jon Legere's](https://twitter.com/JohnLegere) insanity and an old T-Mobile iPad, I have a subscription to [MLB.tv](http://MLB.tv) except — surprise! — that's blacked out until the World Series. And then we come to the message above. What Fox is saying (via TiVo and Verizon FiOS) is that *even though* I've paid for this channel, and want to watch it live, with commercials, I'm not allowed to because... something.

We should look to the NFL for a cautionary tale. Despite a (rather impressive) streaming deal with Twitter that has revitalized a flagging Thursday-night product, ratings are down [11% year-over-year](http://www.espn.com/blog/cleveland/post/_/id/2256/mighty-nfl-grapples-with-tumbling-tv-ratings). As commentators and bloggers scramble to find excuses for an unprecedented ratings drop — suspensions, injuries, even Hillary Clinton — the simple fact is that it has become more difficult to watch major American sports leagues than most other forms of entertainment. In an era when anyone can plop down on their couch and binge on Netflix' ($9.99/month) or HBO's ($14.99/month) high-quality content whenever they want, in HBO's case often *before* an episode airs on linear TV, why should they sit through endless commercials to watch an entertainment product that isn't *better*? During a broadcast earlier this year, a sentence was uttered by a broadcaster which left me speechless: "due to NFL rules, we're not going to be able to show you the end of that game. Instead, here's [our anchors] with the [team] postgame show."

Respect for your customers, fans, users, members — whatever you want to call the consumers of your product — is *essential* to building a sustainable, long-lasting business.
