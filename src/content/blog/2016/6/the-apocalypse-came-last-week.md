  <p>Last week, Apple quietly tightened up the default security settings. Previously, anybody could set their Mac to allow any software to run, regardless of how 'trusted' it was by Gatekeeper. With macOS Sierra's release later this year, the option to allow all software will disappear. The previously-worrisome 'locking down' of the Mac arrived — but in the years since 2012, Gatekeeper &nbsp;has fallen out of view. The increasing availability of Developer ID signing certificates has made the <em>gatekeepgate </em>(catchy, I know) a moot point.</p>
