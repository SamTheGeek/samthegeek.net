A decreasing proportion of ‘computers’ are the heavy-duty trucks of the world and they’re increasingly difficult to afford for the average person. Even the heaviest-duty computers of today — like the Mac Pro — have a similar architecture to the iMac of 2017, and are heavily based on a mobile-phone-like architecture. If you’ve been on an American road in 2022, you’ve seen the Rivian pickup — a truly truck-like truck that is built like a normal car. </p> <a role=\"presentation\" class=\" image-slide-anchor content-fill \" > <img class=\"thumb-image\" elementtiming=\"system-gallery-block-grid\" data-image=\"/images/blog/2022/what-even-is-a-car/apple-mac-pro-display-pro-mac.gif\" data-image-dimensions=\"1286x1286\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Apple_Mac-Pro-Display-Pro_Mac-Pro-Hand-Lift_060319.gif\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"63a4bf8af16a7d3e4e040488\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"/images/blog/2022/what-even-is-a-car/apple-mac-pro-display-pro-mac.gif\" /><br> </a> <a role=\"presentation\" class=\" image-slide-anchor content-fill \" > <img class=\"thumb-image\" elementtiming=\"system-gallery-block-grid\" data-image=\"/images/blog/2022/what-even-is-a-car/rivian-blue.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"2084x1152\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Rivian-Blue.jpg\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"63a4bfb8c1e0a56ba4aba94b\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"/images/blog/2022/what-even-is-a-car/rivian-blue.jpg\" /><br> </a> <p class=\"\">Everyone reading this blog post thinks of a computer as something in a second category — a still-expensive, but not nearly <em>as</em> expensive ‘car’ that covers 80-90% of most people’s needs.

Midjourney generated this photo of a generic crossover for me

A few years ago (with COVID-related time-dilation, 5 years is now ‘a few’) I wrote [a blog post](https://www.samthegeek.net/blog/2017/12/car-based-mac) about the then-imminent iMac Pro comparing it to the first crossover. Back then, I wrote:

The first slide was a lie, the second not so much.

Of course, the electric ‘bicycles’ of the future will look about as similar to a bicycle as an iPhone does to a Motorola Razr. With [delivery drivers suffering heatstroke](https://jalopnik.com/ups-refuses-to-install-air-conditioning-in-150-degree-d-1849377501) on a regular basis, it just makes sense to remove the biggest source of heat in their trucks — the giant internal combustion engine under the driver’s feet.
