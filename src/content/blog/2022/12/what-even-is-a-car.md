Computers and cars have been following the same evolutionary path, just at different speeds, so computers today can offer us a look at the cars of tomorrow. A decreasing proportion of ‘computers’ are the heavy-duty trucks of the world and they’re increasingly difficult to afford for the average person. Even the heaviest-duty computers of today — like the Mac Pro — have a similar architecture to the iMac of 2017, and are heavily based on a mobile-phone-like architecture. If you’ve been on an American road in 2022, you’ve seen the Rivian pickup — a truly truck-like truck that is built like a normal car. </p> <a role=\"presentation\" class=\" image-slide-anchor content-fill \" > <img class=\"thumb-image\" elementtiming=\"system-gallery-block-grid\" data-image=\"/images/blog/2022/what-even-is-a-car/apple-mac-pro-display-pro-mac.gif\" data-image-dimensions=\"1286x1286\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Apple_Mac-Pro-Display-Pro_Mac-Pro-Hand-Lift_060319.gif\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"63a4bf8af16a7d3e4e040488\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"/images/blog/2022/what-even-is-a-car/apple-mac-pro-display-pro-mac.gif" /><br> </a> <a role=\"presentation\" class=\" image-slide-anchor content-fill \" > <img class=\"thumb-image\" elementtiming=\"system-gallery-block-grid\" data-image=\"/images/blog/2022/what-even-is-a-car/rivian-blue.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"2084x1152\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Rivian-Blue.jpg\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"63a4bfb8c1e0a56ba4aba94b\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"/images/blog/2022/what-even-is-a-car/rivian-blue.jpg" /><br> </a> <p class=\"\">Everyone reading this blog post thinks of a computer as something in a second category — a still-expensive, but not nearly <em>as</em> expensive ‘car’ that covers 80-90% of most people’s needs. The MacBook Air fits perfectly into this niche — it’s pricey, but nearly everyone could use it as their sole, everyday computer and be content. Most people will assume that some generic, electric, mid-size crossover fits all their needs, but those are something more akin to an Alienware laptop — packing everything a truck can do into a car-shaped body. </p> <figure class=\" sqs-block-image-figure intrinsic \" > <img data-stretch=\"false\" data-image=\"/images/blog/2022/what-even-is-a-car/generic-ioniq.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"1800x1033\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"\" data-load=\"false\" elementtiming=\"system-image-block\" src=\"/images/blog/2022/what-even-is-a-car/generic-ioniq.png" width=\"1800\" height=\"1033\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 100vw, 100vw\" onload=\"this.classList.add(&quot;loaded&quot;)\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-loader=\"sqs\"> <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\"> <p class=\"\">You’re telling me we have space for everyone to park like this‽</p> </figcaption> </figure> <p class=\"\">The MacBook Air is closer to a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxhAqNLqW0U\">quadricycle</a> than a Hyundai Ioniq 5 — and the majority of cars will look more like a tiny little appliance with minimal features than a big, luxurious crossover with every gadget imaginable. The cities of the future won’t have room — and their residents won’t have the inclination — for big, bulky vehicles that are impossible to park easily. Most round-trip car commutes in the US are less than 50 miles per day, the kilometerage(?) is generally lower throughout Europe. In the next half-decade, microcars will easily <a href=\"https://www.theautopian.com/this-chinese-microcar-is-the-tiny-ev-you-secretly-really-want/\">exceed 100 miles in range</a> making them more than able to handle <em>most</em> driving. And they have an added benefit, since smaller cars mean less weight which means smaller batteries resulting in smaller cars — a virtuous cycle that reduces overall transportation costs, energy needs, and maintenance ♻.<br></p> <a role=\"presentation\" class=\" image-slide-anchor content-fill \" > <img class=\"thumb-image\" elementtiming=\"system-gallery-block-grid\" data-image=\"/images/blog/2022/what-even-is-a-car/apple-macbook-air-m2-availability-july.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"1960x1306\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Apple-MacBook-Air-M2-availability-July-2022-macOS-Monterey.jpg\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"63a4c1b136438d5593072e40\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"/images/blog/2022/what-even-is-a-car/apple-macbook-air-m2-availability-july.jpg" /><br> </a> <a role=\"presentation\" class=\" image-slide-anchor content-fill \" > <img class=\"thumb-image\" elementtiming=\"system-gallery-block-grid\" data-image=\"/images/blog/2022/what-even-is-a-car/cl-20-005-002.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"2894x2174\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"CL 20.005.002.jpg\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"63a4c1dd4655f07a0fe77dd6\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"/images/blog/2022/what-even-is-a-car/cl-20-005-002.jpg" /><br> </a> <p class=\"\">Over 95% of the computers in the world pretend that they’re not computers.

  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Just as the iMac Pro spawned a half decade of ‘car-based trucks,’ the AMC Eagle gave us 40 years of crossovers — but what comes next? Computers and cars have been following the same evolutionary path, just at different speeds, so computers today can offer us a look at the cars of tomorrow. A decreasing proportion of ‘computers’ are the heavy-duty trucks of the world and they’re increasingly difficult to afford for the average person. Even the heaviest-duty computers of today — like the Mac Pro — have a similar architecture to the iMac of 2017, and are heavily based on a mobile-phone-like architecture. If you’ve been on an American road in 2022, you’ve seen the Rivian pickup — a truly truck-like truck that is built like a normal car. </p>

  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Everyone reading this blog post thinks of a computer as something in a second category — a still-expensive, but not nearly <em>as</em> expensive ‘car’ that covers 80-90% of most people’s needs. The MacBook Air fits perfectly into this niche — it’s pricey, but nearly everyone could use it as their sole, everyday computer and be content. Most people will assume that some generic, electric, mid-size crossover fits all their needs, but those are something more akin to an Alienware laptop — packing everything a truck can do into a car-shaped body. </p>

  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The MacBook Air is closer to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxhAqNLqW0U">quadricycle</a> than a Hyundai Ioniq 5 — and the majority of cars will look more like a tiny little appliance with minimal features than a big, luxurious crossover with every gadget imaginable. The cities of the future won’t have room — and their residents won’t have the inclination — for big, bulky vehicles that are impossible to park easily. Most round-trip car commutes in the US are less than 50 miles per day, the kilometerage(?) is generally lower throughout Europe. In the next half-decade, microcars will easily <a href="https://www.theautopian.com/this-chinese-microcar-is-the-tiny-ev-you-secretly-really-want/">exceed 100 miles in range</a> making them more than able to handle <em>most</em> driving. And they have an added benefit, since smaller cars mean less weight which means smaller batteries resulting in smaller cars — a virtuous cycle that reduces overall transportation costs, energy needs, and maintenance ♻.<br></p>

  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Over 95% of the computers in the world pretend that they’re not computers. They’re called ‘phones’ — fifteen years ago, we were pitched a “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=1m50s&amp;v=x7qPAY9JqE4">revolutionary mobile phone</a>” that has turned out to be everything <em>but</em> a revolution in phone calls. Most humans use a very cheap method of computing that claimed to be something else entirely. It shouldn’t take much of a leap to recognize how the ‘electric bicycle’ is in the same category. </p>

  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Of course, the electric ‘bicycles’ of the future will look about as similar to a bicycle as an iPhone does to a Motorola Razr. With <a href="https://jalopnik.com/ups-refuses-to-install-air-conditioning-in-150-degree-d-1849377501">delivery drivers suffering heatstroke</a> on a regular basis, it just makes sense to remove the biggest source of heat in their trucks — the giant internal combustion engine under the driver’s feet. The shape of transportation is going to change as much over the next two decades as computing did over the past two, and it’s likely to have the same level of impact on the way everyone lives their lives.</p>
