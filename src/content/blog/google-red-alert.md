Google's response to ChatGPT has been nothing short of a full-scale panic. The company that once defined search and artificial intelligence now finds itself scrambling to compete with OpenAI's breakthrough chatbot.

But the real question isn't whether Google can respond—it's whether they ever possessed the capability to genuinely compete in this space. Despite years of AI research and development, despite DeepMind and Google Brain, the company seems fundamentally unprepared for this moment.

The infrastructure is there. The talent is there. But somewhere along the way, Google lost the ability to ship products that feel magical. They became too cautious, too focused on protecting existing revenue streams, too bureaucratic.

ChatGPT didn't just disrupt search—it exposed a deeper truth about Google's organizational challenges. The question now is whether they can overcome those challenges before it's too late.
