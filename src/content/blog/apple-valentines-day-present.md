Apple plans to deprecate its legacy HomeKit architecture on February 10, 2026, with OS version 26.3. The timing of this deprecation may coincide with new hardware launches including a potential Apple TV refresh and rumored "HomePod with a screen."

This change represents a significant shift in Apple's smart home strategy, moving away from the older architecture to a more modern foundation. Users will need to be prepared for this transition, which may require updates to their HomeKit-enabled devices and automations.

The Valentine's Day timing is curious and suggests Apple may have something special planned for that date—perhaps the launch of new hardware that takes advantage of the updated architecture.
