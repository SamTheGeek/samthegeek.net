According to [HomeKit Authority](https://www.homekitauthority.com/apple-to-end-support-for-legacy-apple-home-architecture-in-february-2026/) Apple will be deprecating the original HomeKit architecture on February 10 of next year.

Presumably, this means the OS versions numbered 26.3 will launch on that date and force the upgrade, and it’s likely that a new Apple TV — and perhaps the long-rumored ‘HomePod with a screen’ — will launch on or around that date as well.
