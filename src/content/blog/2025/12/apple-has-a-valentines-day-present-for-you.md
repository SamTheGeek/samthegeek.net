  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">According to HomeKit Authority (<a href="https://www.homekitauthority.com/apple-to-end-support-for-legacy-apple-home-architecture-in-february-2026/">https://www.homekitauthority.com/apple-to-end-support-for-legacy-apple-home-architecture-in-february-2026/</a>) Apple will be deprecating the original HomeKit architecture on February 10 of next year. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Presumably, this means the OS versions numbered 26.3 will launch on that date and force the upgrade, and it’s likely that a new Apple TV — and perhaps the long-rumored ‘HomePod with a screen’ — will launch on or around that date as well. </p>
